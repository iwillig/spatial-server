# Spatial Server

## Introduction

A JVM based tile and feature server based on PostgreSQL and
PostGIS. This tool is inspired by
[pg_featureserv](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_featureserv) and
[pg_tileserve](https://github.com/CrunchyData/pg_tileserv) by CrunchData.

This tool is designed to be easy to deploy and run in your cloud
infrastructure. All you need is a system that can run Java 11 and
PostgreSQL. Spatial Server takes care of the rest.

Spatial Server implements several of the latest OCG standards,
including the **OGC Feature Service**, the **OGC Tile Serve API** and the **OGC
Processing API**.

The combination of these three API should give users the ability to
edit, render and analysis spatial information.

Spatial Server also exposes its internal metrics via [Open
Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTEL). This will allow you to
monitor your server via open source and standard tools.
